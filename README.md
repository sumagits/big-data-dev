# Suma Soma
## Current
- I am a graduate student here pursuing Masters's in Applied Computer Science. I am in my final semester.
## Background
- I have one year of experience in Android and two years in Managing the complete design and launch of the company's First product www.content-kart.com.  (Links to an external site.) Handled modules in the project single-handedly and made the application stable by identifying maximum issues at the early stages of testing. 
## Plans
- I aspire to achieve greater heights in the future. I am not completely on to the development side but I know a little bit about Android and testing web applications using the selenium tool. Now, I want to learn front end and other technologies too.

- Here is some area's of interest I'm looking for:

Front End Development, Android.
